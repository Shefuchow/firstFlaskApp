1. Have to make an enviornment
- used https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-python-and-flask-development-environment
- Using python 3.7.3 -> check using `python --version`
- create virtual enviornment with command `python -m venv <myproject>`
- then make sure to activate the virtual enviornment `source myproject/bin/activate`
- install flask using pip as a package manager 
    - check your pip verison `pip --version`
    - install flask `pip install flask`
    - organize a requirements.txt file `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
    - check flask version `flask --version` i'm using 1.1.1
    - you can quick start with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
